# MCP Agentic SDLC

A comprehensive framework for managing software development lifecycle with AI agents, combining structured development processes with intelligent workflow management.

## Overview

MCP Agentic SDLC consists of two main components:

1. **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** - [`SLDC.md`](./SLDC.md)
   - Structured development process
   - Project planning and management
   - Development phases and milestones
   - Quality assurance procedures

2. **Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP)** - [`AWP.md`](./AWP.md)
   - Human-AI collaboration workflow
   - Context management
   - Progress tracking
   - Standardized procedures

## Getting Started

1. Read [`SLDC.md`](./SLDC.md) for the development lifecycle framework
2. Read [`AWP.md`](./AWP.md) for the workflow protocol
3. Check the `examples/` directory for practical implementations

## Features

- Structured development process
- Clear human-AI collaboration guidelines
- Context preservation mechanisms
- Standardized commit messages
- Progress tracking
- Documentation synchronization
- Example implementations

## Documentation

- [`SLDC.md`](./SLDC.md) - Software Development Lifecycle documentation
- [`AWP.md`](./AWP.md) - Agentic Workflow Protocol documentation
- `examples/` - Example implementations and use cases
