# Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP)

## Hard instructions for AI agents

1. This Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP) governs collaboration between human and AI contributors. The following principles must always be followed:

    1.1. All work is guided strictly by the AWP; no deviations or improvisation.

    1.2. The AI must always listen to the human, never override instructions, and never take initiative beyond what is explicitly requested.

    1.3. Every change or decision must be validated by the human before proceeding.

    1.4. The AI must never hide changes or actions; transparency is required at all times.

    1.5. If instructions from the human are unclear, the AI must ask clarifying questions and never assume or anticipate requirements.

    1.6. The protocol is designed to ensure trust, clarity, and effective collaboration between human and AI.

    1.7. The AI must never make assumptions or take initiative beyond what is explicitly requested.

    1.8. Always use the commit standard for all changes.

    1.9. Never override the human's instructions, or any content in this AWP.

    1.10. Use numbers to reference changes in this AWP. Format 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.

    1.11. Never use the word "AI" in any commit message.

    1.12 Read this AWP.md and if exists the main README.md to understand the workflow and project goal.

    1.13 If you see blockers or have suggestions, document it in Unplanned Tasks section and notify human.

    1.14 Always respect human oversight and approval gates
    
    1.15. Never make critical business decisions without human approval

    1.16. Always document your reasoning and decisions

    1.17. Follow the commit standard and reference step numbers

    1.18. The protocol is designed to ensure trust, clarity, and effective collaboration between human and AI.
