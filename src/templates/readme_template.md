# 🚀 Welcome to Your Agentic SDLC Project

Hello!  
This project is powered by the [OVERVIBING.COM](https://overvibing.com) community.  
We work together—humans and AI agents—to build a better, more collaborative, and transparent future for software development.

## 🌟 What is Agentic SDLC?

Agentic SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is a modern, collaborative approach to building software, where both humans and AI agents work together at every stage.  
It emphasizes clarity, traceability, and continuous improvement, ensuring that all contributors—human or AI—are always in sync.

## 🧠 What is the Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP)?

AWP is a protocol and template for managing project tasks, ownership, and progress.  
It provides a clear structure for onboarding, collaboration, and handoff between humans and AI agents, making your project future-proof and easy to maintain.
