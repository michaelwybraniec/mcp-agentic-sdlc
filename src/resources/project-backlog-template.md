# Project Backlog Template

This is a **template** for creating project backlogs using the Agentic SDLC methodology. This template should be used as a **guide** for generating project-specific backlogs, not as an actual project backlog.

## Template Structure

### Planned Tasks Section
The planned tasks should be generated based on the project's overview phases:

```markdown
## Planned Tasks

- [ ] [Task 1: Phase Name](tasks/planned/task-1.md)
- [ ] [Task 2: Phase Name](tasks/planned/task-2.md)
- [ ] [Task 3: Phase Name](tasks/planned/task-3.md)
```

### Unplanned Tasks Section
For scope management and tracking unplanned work:

```markdown
## Unplanned Tasks

*No unplanned tasks yet*
```

### Completed Tasks Section
For tracking completed work:

```markdown
## Completed Tasks

*No completed tasks yet*
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Generate tasks based on project phases**: Create one task per phase from the project overview
2. **Use hierarchical numbering**: Task IDs should be sequential (1, 2, 3, etc.)
3. **Link to individual task files**: Each task should link to its corresponding markdown file
4. **Include project context**: Add project goals, technology stack, and success criteria at the bottom

## Example Implementation

When creating a backlog for a project with phases:
- "1. Project Setup & Design"
- "2. Core Development" 
- "3. Testing & Deployment"

Generate:
- Task 1: Project Setup & Design
- Task 2: Core Development
- Task 3: Testing & Deployment

## Template Variables

Replace these placeholders with actual project data:
- `{PROJECT_GOALS}` - Project objectives
- `{TECHNOLOGY_STACK}` - Technologies used
- `{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}` - Success metrics

**Note**: This is a template for backlog creation, not an actual project backlog. Use this to generate project-specific backlogs following the Agentic SDLC methodology.
