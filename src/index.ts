Hello!  
This project is powered by the [OVERVIBING.COM](https://overvibing.com) community.  
We work together‚Äîhumans and AI agents‚Äîto build a better, more collaborative, and transparent future for software development.

Authored by [ONE-FRONT.COM](https://one-front.com)

## üåü What is Agentic SDLC?

Agentic SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) is a modern, collaborative approach to building software, where both humans and AI agents work together at every stage.  
It emphasizes clarity, traceability, and continuous improvement, ensuring that all contributors‚Äîhuman or AI‚Äîare always in sync.

---

## üß† What is the Agentic Workflow Protocol (AWP)?

AWP is a protocol and template for managing project tasks, ownership, and progress.  
It provides a clear structure for onboarding, collaboration, and handoff between humans and AI agents, making your project future-proof and easy to maintain.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- 'README.md' - This file. Project overview, philosophy, and quickstart.
- 'ASDLC.md' - Agentic SDLC plan and lifecycle documentation.
- 'AWP.md' - Agentic Workflow Protocol template for your project.
- 'src/' - Source code for your project.
- 'agentic-sldc/' - Generated folder for SDLC and workflow docs.

---

## üö¶ Getting Started

1. Read through this README.md to understand the project‚Äôs philosophy.
2. Review ASDLC.md for the lifecycle plan and key milestones.
3. Fill out AWP.md to define your workflow, roles, and steps.
4. Sync with your team and AI agents - keep docs and code up to date!
5. Use the commit standard (see AWP.md) for all changes.

---

## ü§ñ Human + AI Collaboration

- Clear roles: Both humans and AI agents have defined responsibilities.
- Transparent workflow: Every step, handoff, and decision is documented.
- Continuous improvement: Regularly review and update docs and code.

---

## üí° Best Practices

- Keep README.md, ASDLC.md, and AWP.md in sync with your codebase.
- Reference step numbers in every commit message.
- Use the procedures in AWP.md for updates, commits, and handoffs.
- Encourage feedback and document blockers or suggestions.

<!-- Review README.md and AWP.md after each step. Mark the current step as done. Update docs to reflect the current state and next actions. Check for blockers. Ensure docs and code are aligned. -->

### commit
<!-- Commit changes using the commitStandard. Use the format: type(scope step): subject. Reference the step number in every commit message. Follow conventional commit standards. Include relevant files. -->

### next
<!-- Move to the next actionable step only after update and commit are complete. Identify the next actionable step and begin work. Check for blockers before proceeding. -->

### check
<!-- Review AWP.md to determine the current actionable step. Find the first step not done. Restore context and understand what needs to be done. Use this when returning to work after a break or context loss. -->

### handoff
<!-- Transfer task ownership between human and AI. Package current context and deliverables. Notify receiving party with clear expectations. Set timeout for response and escalation rules. -->
