## 🏷️ Key Concepts

<div align="center">

| Concept | Definition | Impact |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **🎨 VIBE-CODING** | Creative, uninterrupted coding flow with full immersion in building and shipping | **Positive** - Peak productivity state |
| **⚠️ OVER-VIBING** | Excessive AI delegation leading to context loss and project drift | **Negative** - Risk to project success |
| **🛡️ MCP Agentic SDLC** | Structured framework preventing over-vibing through transparency | **Solution** - Balanced human-AI collaboration |

</div>

### 🎨 **VIBE-CODING**
> A state of creative, uninterrupted coding flow where you (and optionally your AI agent) are fully immersed in building, iterating, and shipping features. MCP Agentic SDLC helps you maintain this flow by keeping your roadmap and progress tracking frictionless and always up to date.

### ⚠️ **OVER-VIBING** 
> When you delegate too much to your AI agent, leading to context loss due to network or LLM limitations. This can result in overlooking project context, losing track of progress, architecture, or complexity.

### 🛡️ **MCP Agentic SDLC**
> Our solution designed to prevent over-vibing by making project strategy, progress, actions, and procedures always visible and reviewable for both humans and AI agents through structured collaboration.

## 🔄 MCP Agentic SDLC Examples

Below is a visual representation of the standard MCP Agentic SDLC for each step:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["Start Step (e.g., 4.2)"])
    Code["Implement Feature/Task"]
    Update["mcp:update\nUpdate README.md & mcp-agentic-sdlc.yml\nMark step as done"]
    Commit["mcp:commit\nCommit with Conventional Commit message"]
    Next["mcp:next\nMove to next step"]
    Review["Review Progress\n(If blockers, raise them)"]
    Done(["Step Complete"])

    Start --> Code --> Update --> Commit --> Next --> Review --> Done
    Review -- "If not ready" --> Start
```

---

## 🧠 Handling Memory Loss or Returning to Work (Diagram)

MCP Agentic SDLC helps you or your agent recover context after a break, LLM reset, or network issue. Here's how:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["Start Step (e.g., 4.2)"])
    Code["Implement Feature/Task"]
    Update["mcp:update\nUpdate README.md & mcp-agentic-sdlc.yml\nMark step as done"]
    Commit["mcp:commit\nCommit with Conventional Commit message"]
    Next["mcp:next\nMove to next step"]
    Review["Review Progress\n(If blockers, raise them)"]
    Done(["Step Complete"])
    MemoryLoss["Lost Context? (e.g., after break, LLM reset)"]
    Recall["Consult mcp-agentic-sdlc.yml\nRestore context, see progress, next actions"]

    Start --> Code --> Update --> Commit --> Next --> Review --> Done
    Review -- "If not ready" --> Start
    Done --> MemoryLoss
    MemoryLoss -- "Yes" --> Recall --> Start
    MemoryLoss -- "No" --> Start
```

## 🛠️ How to Use MCP Agentic SDLC in Your Project

### Option 1: Using the MCP Server (Recommended)

1. **Install the MCP Agentic SDLC server** in your development environment
2. **Use the `base` tool** to collect your project requirements:
   - Project goals and objectives
   - Development phases and milestones  
   - Technology stack and tools
   - Success criteria and outcomes
3. **Use the `init` tool** to create your complete project structure:
   - Creates `agentic-sdlc/` directory in your project
   - Generates `AWP.md` with your project details
   - Creates project backlog using the backlog recipe methodology
   - Sets up task structure with planned/unplanned/completed directories
4. **Use the `get_backlog_recipe` tool** to access the complete backlog creation methodology
5. **Follow the AWP procedures** in your generated `AWP.md` file

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Copy a template** (or start from scratch) and place it in your project root as `mcp-agentic-sdlc.yml`.
2. **Edit the header**: Add your name, organization, and contact info.
3. **Define your goal and outcome**: Clearly state what your project aims to achieve and what success looks like.
4. **Set up collaboration**: Define which tasks are for humans vs AI agents.
5. **List your main steps** in the `overview` and break them down in the `steps` section. Use nested steps for complex projects.
6. **Follow the procedures**:
   - **update**: After each step, review and update both `README.md` and `mcp-agentic-sdlc.yml` to reflect the current state and next actions. Mark steps as done.
   - **commit**: Commit your changes using the commit standard, referencing the relevant step.
   - **next**: Move to the next actionable step only after update and commit are complete. Check for blockers before proceeding.
   - **check**: Use this to find the next actionable step (first not done) and restore context after a break.
   - **handoff**: Transfer task ownership between human and AI when needed.
7. **Keep everything in sync**: The goal is to keep documentation, workflow, and codebase always aligned.

<div align="center">

### *Professional guidelines for optimal MCP Agentic SDLC implementation*

</div>

### 🚀 **MCP Server Usage**

<div align="center">

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|--------|----------|
| Use `base` tool first to collect all requirements | Skip requirement collection |
| Specify `appDir` parameter for correct project location | Assume default directory |
| Access `recipe://backlog-recipe` for task creation guidance | Create tasks without methodology |
| Follow generated `AWP.md` procedures | Ignore established procedures |

</div>

### 🎯 **General Practices**

<div align="center">

| 📋 Practice | 🎯 Purpose | 🔧 Implementation |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Update Documentation** | Keep everything in sync | Update `AWP.md` and `README.md` after each step |
| **Follow Procedures** | Maintain consistency | Use procedures section as canonical workflow |
| **Reference Steps** | Enable traceability | Include step number in every commit message |
| **Use Commit Standards** | Enable automation | Follow `commitStandard` for all commits |
| **Define Ownership** | Prevent confusion | Clearly define human vs AI task ownership |
| **Document Blockers** | Maintain transparency | Document and address blockers before proceeding |

</div>

### 🛡️ **Quality Assurance**

- ✅ **Always update** both `AWP.md` and `README.md` after each step
- ✅ **Use procedures** section as your canonical workflow for update, commit, next, check, and handoff
- ✅ **Reference step numbers** in every commit message for traceability
- ✅ **Follow commit standards** for all commits to enable automation
- ✅ **Define clear ownership** between human and AI to prevent confusion
- ✅ **Use handoff procedures** when transferring work between human and AI
