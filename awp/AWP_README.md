## üåü What is MCP Agentic SLDC?

**MCP Agentic SLDC** is a transparent, agentic, and collaborative Software Development Lifecycle management standard. It is designed for both solo developers and teams (including AI agents), ensuring everyone stays in sync, code and docs are always aligned, and progress is transparent. MCP Agentic SLDC is both human- and machine-readable, making it ideal for hybrid human/AI workflows.

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Key Terms

**VIBE-CODING**
> A state of creative, uninterrupted coding flow, where you (and optionally your agent) are fully immersed in building, iterating, and shipping features. MCP Agentic SLDC helps you stay in this flow by keeping your roadmap and progress tracking frictionless and always up to date.

**OVER-VIBING**
> This is when you let your agent work for you too much, and then it forgets the context due to network or LLM limitations. It can lead to overlooking the context, and/or losing track of the project's progress, architecture, or complexity.

**MCP Agentic SLDC**
> MCP Agentic SLDC is designed to prevent over-vibing by making project strategy, progress, actions, and procedures always visible and reviewable for humans and agents through structured human-AI collaboration.

## üîÑ MCP Agentic SLDC Examples

Below is a visual representation of the standard MCP Agentic SLDC for each step:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["Start Step (e.g., 4.2)"])
    Code["Implement Feature/Task"]
    Update["mcp:update\nUpdate README.md & mcp-agentic-sldc.yml\nMark step as done"]
    Commit["mcp:commit\nCommit with Conventional Commit message"]
    Next["mcp:next\nMove to next step"]
    Review["Review Progress\n(If blockers, raise them)"]
    Done(["Step Complete"])

    Start --> Code --> Update --> Commit --> Next --> Review --> Done
    Review -- "If not ready" --> Start
```

---

## üß† Handling Memory Loss or Returning to Work (Diagram)

MCP Agentic SLDC helps you or your agent recover context after a break, LLM reset, or network issue. Here's how:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start(["Start Step (e.g., 4.2)"])
    Code["Implement Feature/Task"]
    Update["mcp:update\nUpdate README.md & mcp-agentic-sldc.yml\nMark step as done"]
    Commit["mcp:commit\nCommit with Conventional Commit message"]
    Next["mcp:next\nMove to next step"]
    Review["Review Progress\n(If blockers, raise them)"]
    Done(["Step Complete"])
    MemoryLoss["Lost Context? (e.g., after break, LLM reset)"]
    Recall["Consult mcp-agentic-sldc.yml\nRestore context, see progress, next actions"]

    Start --> Code --> Update --> Commit --> Next --> Review --> Done
    Review -- "If not ready" --> Start
    Done --> MemoryLoss
    MemoryLoss -- "Yes" --> Recall --> Start
    MemoryLoss -- "No" --> Start
```

| **procedures**    | Core workflow actions (update, commit, next, check, etc.)   |
| **notes**         | Reminders and project-wide policies                         |
| **commitStandard**| Commit message format, rules, and examples                  |

**Section Details:**
- **init**: Step-by-step onboarding for new contributors or agents.
- **goal**: The north star for the project.
- **overview**: A list of the main phases or milestones.
- **outcome**: What success looks like.
- **steps**: A tree of all actionable steps, each with a number, name, description, done status, and ownership (human vs AI).
- **procedures**: Canonical definitions for `update`, `commit`, `next`, `check`, and `handoff` actions. These ensure everyone (and every agent) follows the same workflow for updating docs, committing, and progressing.
- **notes**: Project-wide reminders, policies, or tips.
- **commitStandard**: The required format for all commit messages, with types, rules, and examples.
- **collaboration**: Rules for human-AI task ownership, handoffs, and approval gates.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use MCP Agentic SLDC in Your Project

1. **Copy a template** (or start from scratch) and place it in your project root as `mcp-agentic-sldc.yml`.
2. **Edit the header**: Add your name, organization, and contact info.
3. **Define your goal and outcome**: Clearly state what your project aims to achieve and what success looks like.
4. **Set up collaboration**: Define which tasks are for humans vs AI agents.
5. **List your main steps** in the `overview` and break them down in the `steps` section. Use nested steps for complex projects.
6. **Follow the procedures**:
   - **update**: After each step, review and update both `README.md` and `mcp-agentic-sldc.yml` to reflect the current state and next actions. Mark steps as done.
   - **commit**: Commit your changes using the commit standard, referencing the relevant step.
   - **next**: Move to the next actionable step only after update and commit are complete. Check for blockers before proceeding.
   - **check**: Use this to find the next actionable step (first not done) and restore context after a break.
   - **handoff**: Transfer task ownership between human and AI when needed.
7. **Keep everything in sync**: The goal is to keep documentation, workflow, and codebase always aligned.

## üìã Best Practices

- Always update both `mcp-agentic-sldc.yml` and `README.md` after each step.
- Use the `procedures` section as your canonical workflow for update, commit, next, check, and handoff.
- Reference the step number in every commit message.
- Use the `commitStandard` for all commits to enable automation and traceability.
- Clearly define human vs AI task ownership to prevent confusion.
- Use handoff procedures when transferring work between human and AI.
- If you see blockers, critical points, or have suggestions, document and address them before moving on.
- Use the `init` section to onboard new contributors or agents.
- Review the `notes` section for project-wide policies.
- Set up approval gates for critical human decisions.
